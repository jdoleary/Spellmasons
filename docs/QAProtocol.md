## Findings:
- index.fdcafa98.js:5 Dev warning: poison supportsQuantity; however quantity was not provided to the addModifier function.
- unit standing on health pickup looked like it triggered it but then died anyway, this is now due to the async nature of when pickups are handled.  If the unit is taking exactly death damage
