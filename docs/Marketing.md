        - Show lots of variety in the steampage
            - screenshot rules
                - variety of environments
                - varity of visual effects
                - show in-game menus
                - better to have fewer screenshots than to repeat
            - the page itself
                - put game assets throughout the page
                - show, don't tell. Don't waste words describing what can be shown
                - problem: unclear genre, what do you do
                    - verb focused short descriptions
                    - explain that it's turn-based, and rogue-like
                    - avoid screenshots that don't show the genre
                - make steam tagging algorithm WORK FOR YOU. THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT, EVERYTHING IS BASED ON TAGS
                    - look at similar popular games and their tags
                - Prevent "dead game syndrome"
                    - players want to play a game that looks like it has attention.  I should be posting regular events in steam to show that it's active
                    - Look at "chicken police" events
                - In forums:
                    - answer if it's coming to switch and if it's 60fps
                    - Pin a "Where to find us" post
                    - show that you're communicating with your audience
                - You can continue to update the game after it's released
                - don't give up, keep trying things until it works
                - wishlists are the key metric

    - Trailer
        - FTL's trailer has a dynamic camera, it shows the UI but it's zooming in on key parts

            - Shots should end once their main idea is expressed
            - Don't get hung up on editing style - focus on the trailer's goals
            - Show trailer to someone who doesn't know anything about the game
            - Don't show everything
            - More information can be less interesting
                - if you say too much you can go past the sale and turn off
            - start the trailer with the most important, unique, or exciting idea

                - Introduce the new ideas early.
                - You want the audience to see your game's potential "omg I can do this and this and this!"
                - Good music.
                - Actions/cuts on the music beat.
                - Does your trailer tell a story? Or is it a bunch of random scenes together?
                - Turn off the HUD / only show important parts to the shot.
                    - turn off cursor, it's like a little virtual fly and distracting
                - Show your trailer to someone who doesn't know anything about your game.
                - Don't show everything in the trailer.

            - Use the language of film and editing to focus on the experience and feel of the game, not the minute details

            - Keep short rather than empty
                - 60 - 90 seconds is standard
            - Many kinds of trailers
                - One to introduce it
                - Another to show what multiplayer is like coordinating with friends.
            - Make it fun to listen to
            - Show content, don't count it out visually. Viewers don't care if you have "10,000 unique spells!"
            - Keep it fun

- Notes from https://www.progamemarketing.com/courses/1270885/lectures/29635980
    - Know what you game is and what games it is similar to
        - Genre is very important
        - Be specific and clear
    - Steam page main goals
        1. Tell steam algorithm what type of game my game is
        2. Make the game look attractive to players and high quality
    - Developers who understand their game better and other related games in the market have a better time
    - Understand your core gameloop
    - Great capsule
        - eye catching
        - demonstrates quality
        - hints at the mood of the game
        - shows genre
        - doesn't over explain
    - The "More like this" Section on your steam page tells you if your game is tagged correctly. If they are just a random assortment than steam doesn't know your game well
    - Use the **tag wizard** specifically for editing your tags. It's under 'Edit Store Page' > 'Tags'
    - In the tagging wizard, adjust the tag priority until the similar games are arranged as you want them to be
- Twitter Marketing https://howtomarketagame.com/2022/08/01/how-to-go-viral-on-twitter/
- Screenshots
    - Show the UI
    - Show who you play as
    - Indicate the game and genre
    - The first 4 are the most important, they get sent out in the email
    - showcase the core gameplay loop
    - don't show start menu
    - do show variety
    - don't use dark images for first 4
    - don't add text (in post) to screenshots (ui is okay)
- Steam videos
    - Get right to gameplay
    - no logos, no cinematics, no title cards. For steam, just do gameplay
- What are shoppers thinking:
    - is the game pretty?
    - is it high quality? (bugs, jank, depth)
    - What genre is it and would i like it
    - how is the game played (turn based, dialog choices, 3rd person, etc)
    - is the game being updated
    - what is the high concept, is the game unique
- My steam page must
    - show how the game is played
    - show what makes the game unique **Show spells cast in different order**
    - Subtly look high quality and high value with lots of gameplay
    - Add a buy embed at the bottom of the "Read more" just like RogueLegacy2 does
- Short description
    - Be very specific not generic
        - no: go on missions
        - yes: sneak into an embassy in london
