Copyright protects the work, trademark protects the name.  I think I need a trademark.

Waiting to be contacted by
    - Noble Path Trademark Law (I chatted)
    - Buckert Law Firm (I filled out a form)

# Questions for lawyer
- What is the risk of trademark conflicts
- What happens if my tradmark submission is rejected AFTER the game is published?

## Alternate name ideas:
-Wizard's Workshop
-Spellcrafter
-Enchanter's Lab
-The Art of Magic


## Meeting with Laywer John
- Recommends registration for trademark
- when you register a trademark, you register it in relation to the specific product or service in which it's associated in the eyes of American consumers
- Fee $350 per class
- flat fee includes 1 filing fee of one application of one class ($1450)
- "trade" means its an indicator of the source of the product being sold
- wait to get sales across state lines to claim "in commerse"
- "intent to use" application you can file before you're "in commerse"
- bottom line: class of goods for my application is different than the class for the book series
- Pengin may be movitated to throw attourney fees at the wall to protect their intellectual property
- The USPTO is the ones we file with first, they assign Attourney Examiner. They evaluation "consumer confusion"
- Govt main point of interest is if "consumers know what they're buying and who they're buying it from".
- John will do a "Prefiling clearance search"
- Then he'll write me an opinion letter, high medium or low forcast of failure
- Then i tell him if i want to proceed with application drafting and filing
- US is not "first to file" jourisdiction. it's about who's using "the mark" the longest
- Possible for them to have my trademark cancelled (within 5-6 years)
- then I could file declaration of post.. something .. use.
- They could oppose my registration even after I'm approved by USPTO in the "publication phase".
- You can't register a single book title as a trademark but you can as a series.
- A trademark is strong when it doesn't merely describe what it's protecting like "Detroit such and such company"
- Spellmasons is not merely descriptive, so it's a strong enough trademark, the only question is whether there are potential conflicts
- The title is not relevant in a copyright standpoint
- Two types of applications: 
- "In use" application (this is ideal, evidence of in use is called a specimine)
    - as long as I keep using mark in commerse I can continue to own it as long as I continue to sell video games under that name, I can continue to file renewals
- "Intent to Use" lacks specimine, then we file a following document once I have sales.
- In litigation, hourly fees apply
- Risks
    - Ulimate risk is investing time and capital in a brand that has to change under threat of litigation
    - Before I launch is when I want a clear run and get the application filed
    - I don't want to get into sales and reviews and then have to rebrand
    - Good to proceed with clearance search and retain attourney prelaunch
    - **I always have the option to rebrand after an opposition or cancellation proceeding is filed**
    - To take profits from me that would have to prove bad intent on my part
        - A judge could order turning over physical inventory like t-shirts or merch
    - Mostly what would happen is an injunction demanding stop use or worst-case pay attourney fees.
    - John would be less suprised by USPTO examiner arguing that there's a likelihood of confusion due to both products being fantasy based.
    - The trademark office has to argue that the products are **related** for there to be a conflict
- I **should** actually launch and sell the product while the trademark is in application
- 6-8 months to get response from examiner- post filing
    - to have John file counter argument $1500-2000
- clearance search happens quicker
- hire within 5 days to save $100 for consult fee
- Best to communicate over email
