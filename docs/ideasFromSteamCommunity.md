A few balance feedback items
Spells generally seem well costed for what they do.

However the following 3 from what ive seen could use some attention.

1) Poison at 20 mana seems rather steep for a 10 point DoT considering the other options on the table. I would either lower the mana cost to 15 or 10, or increase the damage.

2) Contaminate seems very steep at 50 mana for spreading debuffs, considering the wealth of 20 point targetting spells. I would consider lowering it's cost

3) Targetting Column. Its to narrow and short at 20 mana compared to Cone, Connect, Circle, and other targetting spells at the same mana cost. Either reduce its cost to 15 or increase it's width and/or preferably length (cone is both wider and longer than column for example)

That's it. Noticed some UI/refresh bugs I might also report if they haven't been brought up yet.

Having a lot of fun so far!

A couple observations from my broken run earlier depicted in General:

1) The spell that sacrifices your health to steal mana from enemies has no limit to the amount of mana it can take from enemies, and will take more mana than the enemy has to give if stacked. I was able to achieve over 15k mana by sacrificing all my health with an AoE spam of this spell. Suggestion : this spell needs to be limited to the amount of mana an enemy has to offer.

2) A lengthy spell will continue to cast even after the targeted enemies are dead. It will continue to link to dead enemies that were killed during that same spell resulting in lengthy animation of connections to once alive (now dead) enemies. The same spell continued to cast when entering the next floor, and because I cast blood curse and a ton of heals on all of us, killed my teammates when the spell finally culminated even though we had moved onto the next floor. Suggestion : If a spell contains offensive (or defensive) components, have that spell end if all targets that will be hurt / helped have already died. ( no reason to continue to connect to a mass pile of bodies, or cast fortify on a dead teammate).  Also, have any and all spell effects in progress end when moving to the next floor.

3) When casting an ungodly amount of arrows, the arrows take a very, very long time to shoot. (the developer has already commented on speeding this up) and will continue to shoot after all enemies have died. (this loops back into the last point)

4) When splitting your teammates, they have no control over the split versions of themselves. Not sure if this is intended as the stage ended before we could test this further so I'm not sure if they have auto AI controlling them or what that situation is. Either way I am fine with this as it is funny to me. However, when moving to the next floor, that teammate was still split and still had reduced stats, but none of his little off shoots came with us. This is a pretty big issue for progression. Suggestion : either have split units merge back together on progression to next floor, or have split units come along and spawn with the player when they choose their location.
5) When queueing an absolutely massive amount of spells, it still displays every icon on everyone's screen leading to some pretty blocked views of the map. Suggestion : Have the spell box be limited to a certain amount of icons that each player can then click on ( like an interactable corner) that then expands to the full view and can be collapsed again.

 Passed level 22 - what's next? (and some feedback)
I'm now curious if it makes any sense to continue. Is the game ever designed for such experience? I have 20k health in particular and can summon armies so large that my PC is dying while animating them.


Also some feedback so far:

- I've already mentioned that me and AI can summon very big armies and my PC barely can handle that, we probably need an option to disable animations if nothing really limits army size

- similarly I once used Circle + 8 x Arrow (or similiar) and animation took several minutes for this spell (faster if ALT-TAB out of the game, but still too long)

- need to have more than 1 row for spells, it's not friendly to swap spells from the book, unless it's somehow linked to game mechanics

- it's hard to notice scroll appearance - it may be even out of sight or hidden by units, what's about a message or something?

- Fortify 0.1% - this is the only spell so far I don't get. I need to cast it 100 times to block 10% of damage? It's not funny.

- what's about reordering spells in the casting row? like with drag&drop

- Saves... It's good there are saves, but some usability still needed. Stop... Isn't it roguelike? Why DO we have saves? What's about auto-save? Problem solved.

- screen scrolling speed may be needs to be configurable (I'm not using middle button)


- there should be balance issues too, but since I don't even know what to expect... For examplewhen I have 20k health Shield +30 is useless. Hordes of archers summoned by enemy are useless too. Well, they give me lot of potions of course...

Chris:
"balance: Remove Nullify spell because it was way too powerful in the endgame (I may rethink a way to reintegrate it later)"

I've got a couple worked out thoughts on fixing its balance. Hopefully you like one of them! I believe each of these solutions addresses the problem with the previous version of Nullify but in a different way.

A) Nullify no longer works on the caster, but functions identically to before with regards to enemies and other allies

B) Nullify is split into 2 component spellcards: 
Steadfast - a spell that works like Nullify but only with regards to movement/displacement effects like Pull, Push, Displace, Repel, Vortex. 
Nullify (Stackable) - a spell that only nullifies the next forged damaging component in the same spell it is in. It has to be inside the spell combo to nullify an effect and it only nullifies 1 forged effect (ignoring Targeting components of course). Nullify will only protect against 1 single component in Stacked damages like Rend. 
So if there were Nullify - Nullify - Target:Circle - Rend - Rend - Rend, The caster would take damage from Rend as if they were only hit by a single Rend. Enemies would take damage from 3 Rends.

C) Nullify works as before, but cannot protect the caster against damage that would (if not protected) be at or above their max HP. 
I.E Nullify will protect against a single spell's damage to a caster with 60HP if and only if the damage is 59HP or less. If it is 60HP or more, Nullify fails entirely.

Make Dark Summoners a bit less influential, I got to a stage where I had 3 dark summoners (2 of them minibosses) each in a corner of the map, 
I just spawned in 1 corner and then I was never able to reach the other 2 because I didn't have the correct spells (it was only stage 11)

I think a possible solution for the summoner issue would be to have them summon X creature but with no mana so they have to build up their mana and cant immediately summon more enemies. It would at least buy the player some time to take care of the crowds before more are spawned in
